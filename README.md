# ESO Fishing Map (Classic)
#### A simple project with some HTML, CSS, and SVG to create a fishing map for ESO.
Save the code as shortcode for Wordpress or embed it directly into your website. Then set the size using CSS "max-width" and "width" on the class ".map-container". Everything should scale.


#### Special thanks to
