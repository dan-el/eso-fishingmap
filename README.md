# ESO Fishing Map
A simple project with some HTML, CSS and SVG to create an interactive map for ESO.

Save the code as shortcode for Wordpress or embed it directly into your website.

Set the size using CSS "max-width" and "width" on the class ".map-container". Everything should scale.

Images are not compressed. If you want them smaller use JPG - under 200 KB still looks okay.
