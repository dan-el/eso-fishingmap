# ESO Fishing Map
#### A simple project with some HTML, CSS, and SVG to create an interactive map for ESO.
* Save the code as shortcode for Wordpress or embed it directly into your website.
* Set the size using CSS "max-width" and "width" on the class ".map-container". Everything should scale.

Images are not compressed. If you want them smaller use JPG - under 200 KB still looks okay.


#### Special thanks to
* [Votan](https://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?action=getinfo&userid=13996) for his ESO addon [Votanâ€™s Fisherman](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info918-VotansFisherman.html) which helped creating all the maps
* [aykutaydin91](https://www.reddit.com/user/aykutaydin91) and [daveysanderson](https://www.reddit.com/user/daveysanderson) for their feedback on the color palette
